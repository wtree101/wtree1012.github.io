# About Me

<img src="/images/jasonansel4.jpg" class="floatpic" width="200" height="300">
My name is Jason Ansel.  I am currently working on PyTorch Compilers
at Facebook.

Before Facebook, I was at GoDaddy helping build a deep learning platform
for predicting small business behavior and personalizing experiences across
the company.  I also created [GoDaddy Domain Appraisals], which uses neural
networks to predict the resale value of a domain name better than a human
expert.  I joined GoDaddy in 2013 as part of the [acquisition] of the startup
[Locu], which I joined in 2011 while I was simultaneously getting my Ph.D. at
[MIT][MIT] [CSAIL].

I did my Ph.D. dissertation in the [Commit] group lead by  [Saman Amarasinghe].
I started the [OpenTuner] project, an extensible framework for program
autotuning.  I also created the [PetaBricks] programming language, a language
that incorporates algorithmic choices to allow an integrated autotuner to
explore search spaces of program implementations.  As an undergraduate, I did
research with [Gene Cooperman] and helped create [DMTCP], a user-level
distributed checkpoint/restart system.
