## Coffee Roasting

I drink a lot of coffee, and especially enjoy light roast espresso.  These
lighter roasts allow the flavors of the different types of coffee beans to
stand out more.  Starting in 2009, I roasted my coffee from green coffee beans.
I started out using the oven, then later switched utilizing a series of home
roasting machines.  For those looking to get into coffee roasting, I would
recommend a [Behmor 1600].  I enjoy trying new types of coffee beans and
building tables to explore the search space of roasting parameters.

I love extremely spicy food and cooking. I taught myself cooking by trying
to reproduce spicy dishes I like and with the help of many friends who have
taught me dishes from their home countries. Recently I have been learning
Thai dishes.  I am always up to learn how to to cook a exotic new dish.

## Powerlifting

In my free time I do powerlifting to stay healthy.  While it has been many
years since I competed, I still frequently train.

## Past Hobbies

I previously enjoyed skiing, sailing, horseback riding, climbing, hiking,
and developing/playing computer games. However, I have not had time to do
any of these things recently.
